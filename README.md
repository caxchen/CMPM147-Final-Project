Class: CMPM 147 Generative Design
Link: https://caxchen.github.io/CMPM147-Final-Project/

This project is a procedural spaceship generator with p5.js, that uses Perlin noise to generate spaceships, then adds a series of accessories.  The controls can be found at the top.  
Showcase mode simply causes it to generate a new ship every few seconds.
